pypager
=======

This is the Python implementation of my original page-replacement simulator 
written in C.  I use(d) it on a course on the fundamentals of operating 
systems, you'll find the course [here](https://github.com/dbosk/opsys/).  
You'll find the original C version [here](https://github.com/dbosk/cpager/).  
Personally I prefer the C version, and if you've ever taken a course on 
operating systems you know why.
